    "A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called **keys**, and a collection of\n",
    "values. Each key is associated with a single value. The association of a key and a value is\n",
    "called a **key-value pair** or sometimes an **item**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical language, a dictionary represents a **mapping** from keys to values, so you\n",
    "can also say that each key “maps to” a value. As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that\n",
    "maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the name of a\n",

    "\n",
    "As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking\n",
    "the output by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale down the input:** If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program\n",
    "reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example\n",
    "you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program\n",
    "so it reads only the first n lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is an error, you can reduce n to the smallest value that manifests the error, and\n",
    "then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check summaries and types:** Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider\n",
    "printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or\n",
    "the total of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging\n",
    "this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write self-checks:** Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For\n",
    "example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that\n",
    "the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest.\n",
    "This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if\n",
    "they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format the output:** Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We\n",
    "saw an example in Section 6.9. Another tool you might find useful is the pprint module,\n",
    "which provides a pprint function that displays built-in types in a more human-readable\n",
    "format (pprint stands for “pretty print”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend debugging.\n",

    "**mapping:** A relationship in which each element of one set corresponds to an element of\n",

    "more specific than our previous use of the word “value”.\n",

    "**hashable:** Atype that has a hash function. Immutable types like integers, floats and strings\n",
